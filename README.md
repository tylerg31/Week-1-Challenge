Week 1 Case Study 

“Betterment- A Better Way to Invest?”

The world of wealth management and investment advising has gone through many iterations over the last several generations.  Once the domain of large banks and high net worth clients, investment advising is now offered by institutions both large and small and cater to all clients, from the wealthy elites to the everyman. Consumers now have the option to place their money and their financial futures in the hands of large institutions, hedge funds, private equity firms, or a flourishing list of boutique RIA firms. But we are just now seeing the next evolution in the wealth management sphere: robo-advising. 

Betterment, LLC was founded in 2008 and officially launched in 2009 by Jon Stein and Eli Broverman.  In an interview with NatFluence, Stein, a consultant to many Wall Street banks, felt frustrated by helping banks make larger profits while consumers dealt with high fees, and a time-consuming process to organize and implement efficient savings and investment plans.  This was the impetus to start Betterment. According to CrunchBase, Betterment has gone through a full 10 rounds of financing.  Starting with a modest $3 million investment from venture capital fund Bessemer Partners in 2010, they have ballooned to $435 million in total funds raised through 2021.  Early investors were primary venture capital funds that focused on the tech sector. 

Betterment was envisioned as a cheaper and more user-friendly alternative to big banks and financial advisors for those seeking wealth management services. The aim of the company is to use technology to make investment advisor services easy, convenient, and accessible to more people, especially those who may have little knowledge of the industry.  The “secret sauce” to delivering these aims was to base the firm around robo-advising, or using customer supplied financial data fed into a computer algorithm to generate a goals based investment solution. The solution could then be acted upon immediately by the customer and any further need for rebalancing would also be done without customer intervention. 

Initially Betterment was aimed at retail clients, particularly those who are younger or with a smaller net worth. Younger people or those with smaller net worths and possibly more simplistic tax situations would be the biggest benefactors of a stream-lined platform engineered to deliver investment strategies at a low cost with high ease of use.  However, as Betterment has grown so has its product offering and it’s client base.  Betterment now has platforms geared towards registered investment advisors and 401(k) programs through Betterment for Business. 

Currently, Betterment boasts a customer base of 730,000 clients and $30.7 billion assets under management. They are one of the largest robo-investing firms in the world and initially their biggest advantage was being first to market in this space.  They pioneered the idea of robo-advising and their success had made the idea more palatable to consumers and built up trust from the investing public.  Per job postings for engineers on LinkedIn, Betterment builds its apps with Ruby on Rails and adds the logic for the apps via Julia. 

As Betterment sits in the investment advising domain of the finance industry there is plenty of competition from a variety of different sources.  Over the last several years boutique and independent investment advisory firms have continually claimed market share away from the big banks which used to nearly exclusively occupy this space.  Betterment will compete with large and well known institutions like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs but will also compete with the multitude of independent RIAs that pop up seemingly on a daily basis. The most direct competitor is Wealthfront, another robo-investing company with a similar mission, however larger institutions are starting to offer similar services, as evidenced by Schwab’s SIP and IIP programs, Goldman Sach’s Marcus Invest, and Vanguard’s Personal Invest.

The results of Betterment’s entrance into the advising space have been impressive. They had consistently added both AUM and accounts each year at accelerating rates until 2020 where user growth began to slow. The most relevant metrics to Betterment and others in the robo space are AUM, user growth rate, and new accounts.  Betterment has fared well in each of these categories however, as legacy financial institutions like Vanguard and Schwab enter the space with large existing client bases and brand name recognition, we could expect to see competition for market share become more intense. Currently Betterment ranks 3rd behind Schwab and Vanguard in AUM. 

If I were to advise Betterment on how to improve their offering and stay a step ahead of the competition I would recommend the addition of REITs, non-public investments, and alternative assets to the platform. These asset classes are extremely valuable to a comprehensive financial plan due to their powerful diversification benefits and lower correlation to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. The technological challenge would be integrating these asset classes into their robo-advising structure. Since these assets are most often not publicly traded, suffer from illiquidity, lockup periods, and may have valuations that update infrequently, it would be a challenge to add them to the highly efficient and streamlined robo process with frequent and automated rebalances. Additionally these classes require a high level of human management which further separates them from a business model such as Betterment.  However, Betterment could partner with an outside manager that handles a portfolio of alternative assets and possibly aggregate client investment and redemption requests, say on a quarterly basis.  These could be redeemed with the manager at known intervals and possibly the average valuation price for the period. From a tech point of view this would mean Betterment would have to re-engineer their models for each client who holds a position in alternative assets. My suggestion would to have the model ignore the holding in alternatives and treat the remainder of the client account as 100% of their holdings. Then rebalance the portfolio only at each redemption date if the allocation to alternatives has breeched a pre-specified band.  I realize this approach would have significant drawbacks but that is a discussion for another time.
